# Compliance and Governance Framework

This document outlines the compliance requirements and governance framework for the GAN Cyber Range Simulator project.

## Regulatory Framework

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment

The project aligns with NIST CSF core functions:

1. **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk assessment
2. **Protect**: Access controls and data protection
3. **Detect**: Monitoring and detection capabilities
4. **Respond**: Incident response procedures
5. **Recover**: Recovery planning and improvements

### ISO 27001 Considerations

- Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- Risk assessment and treatment
- Security controls implementation
- Continuous monitoring and improvement

## Data Protection and Privacy

### Data Classification

- **Public**: Documentation and open-source code
- **Internal**: Configuration and non-sensitive operational data
- **Confidential**: Security research data and methodologies
- **Restricted**: Vulnerability information and exploit code

### Data Handling Requirements

```yaml
# Example data classification label
metadata:
  labels:
    data-classification: "confidential"
    retention-period: "2-years"
    geographical-restriction: "us-only"
```

### Privacy Controls

- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- Accuracy requirements
- Security of processing

## Security Controls

### Technical Controls

1. **Access Control** (AC)
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Principle of least privilege

2. **Audit and Accountability** (AU)
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Log integrity protection
   - Regular audit reviews

3. **System and Communications Protection** (SC)
   - Network segmentation
   - Encryption in transit and at rest
   - Secure communication protocols

### Administrative Controls

1. **Personnel Security** (PS)
   - Background checks for privileged access
   - Security awareness training
   - Incident response training

2. **Risk Assessment** (RA)
   - Regular security assessments
   - Vulnerability management
   - Threat modeling

3. **Security Planning** (PL)
   - Security architecture reviews
   - Change management procedures
   - Configuration management

### Physical and Environmental Controls

1. **Physical Access Control** (PE)
   - Secure facility requirements
   - Equipment protection
   - Environmental monitoring

2. **Media Protection** (MP)
   - Secure media handling
   - Data sanitization procedures
   - Media disposal requirements

## Audit and Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Compliance Checks

```python
# Example compliance validation
def validate_security_policies():
    """Validate security policy compliance."""
    checks = [
        check_network_isolation(),
        check_access_controls(),
        check_data_encryption(),
        check_audit_logging()
    ]
    return all(checks)
```

### Compliance Metrics

- Security control effectiveness
- Vulnerability remediation time
- Incident response metrics
- Training completion rates

## Export Control and Legal Considerations

### Export Administration Regulations (EAR)

- Classification of security research tools
- Export licensing requirements
- End-user restrictions

### Intellectual Property

- Open source license compliance
- Third-party component auditing
- Patent considerations
- Trade secret protection

## Vendor and Third-Party Management

### Supply Chain Security

- Vendor security assessments
- Software component analysis
- Dependency vulnerability tracking
- Secure development practices

### Service Provider Oversight

- Cloud provider security reviews
- Data processing agreements
- Subprocessor management
- Regular security assessments

## Incident Response and Business Continuity

### Incident Classification

1. **Category 1**: System compromise or data breach
2. **Category 2**: Service disruption or availability issue
3. **Category 3**: Security policy violation
4. **Category 4**: Compliance violation

### Response Procedures

```yaml
# Incident response workflow
incident_response:
  detection:
    - automated_monitoring
    - user_reporting
    - third_party_notification
  
  analysis:
    - impact_assessment
    - root_cause_analysis
    - evidence_collection
  
  containment:
    - system_isolation
    - access_revocation
    - service_shutdown
  
  recovery:
    - system_restoration
    - service_validation
    - monitoring_enhancement
```

### Business Continuity

- Recovery time objectives (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery point objectives (RPO): 1 hour
- Essential system identification
- Alternative processing sites

## Training and Awareness

### Security Awareness Program

- Annual security training
- Role-specific training requirements
- Phishing simulation exercises
- Incident response drills

### Competency Management

- Security certification requirements
- Continuing education programs
- Skills assessment and development
- Knowledge transfer procedures

## Documentation and Records Management

### Document Control

- Version control systems
- Change approval processes
- Distribution control
- Retention schedules

### Records Retention

| Record Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Audit logs | 7 years | Secure archive |
| Incident reports | 5 years | Encrypted storage |
| Training records | 3 years | HR systems |
| Configuration changes | 2 years | Version control |

## Continuous Improvement

### Management Review

- Quarterly compliance reviews
- Annual framework assessment
- Stakeholder feedback integration
- Performance metric analysis

### Process Improvement

- Regular policy updates
- Control effectiveness reviews
- Technology advancement integration
- Industry best practice adoption
