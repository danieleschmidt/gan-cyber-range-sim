# ADR-003: LLM-Based Agent Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The core innovation of the GAN Cyber Range Simulator is the use of AI agents for both attack and defense operations. We need to decide on the architecture for these agents, considering:

**Agent Capabilities Required:**
- Strategic planning and decision making
- Tool integration (security tools, system commands)
- Learning from previous actions and outcomes
- Adaptation to opponent strategies
- Natural language reasoning about security scenarios

**Technical Considerations:**
- LLM provider selection and integration
- Agent memory and state management
- Tool integration and safety
- Performance and cost optimization
- Offline capabilities for air-gapped environments

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Rule-based agents**: Predictable but limited adaptability
2. **Traditional ML agents**: Require extensive training data and domain expertise
3. **LLM-based agents**: Leverage pre-trained knowledge with fine-tuning capability
4. **Hybrid approach**: Combine LLMs with traditional ML for specific tasks

## Decision

We will implement an LLM-based agent framework with the following architecture:

### Agent Architecture

         ▼                       ▼                       ▼

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### LLM Integration Strategy
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, with plugin architecture
- **Model Selection**: Different models for different tasks (planning vs execution)
- **Cost Optimization**: Caching, request batching, and model size selection
- **Fallback Strategy**: Local models (Llama, Mistral) for air-gapped deployments

### Tool Integration Framework
- **Sandboxed Execution**: All tool calls run in isolated containers
- **Safety Filters**: Prevent dangerous operations outside simulation
- **Tool Catalog**: Standardized interface for security tools (nmap, metasploit, etc.)
- **Custom Tools**: Framework for adding domain-specific capabilities

### Memory and Learning System
- **Short-term Memory**: Conversation context and current scenario state
- **Long-term Memory**: Vector database for storing experiences and patterns
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relationships between vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses
- **Learning Feedback**: Reward signals for reinforcement learning integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Adaptability**: Agents can handle novel scenarios without pre-programming
- **Natural Reasoning**: Leverage human-like reasoning about security concepts
- **Rapid Development**: Faster than training custom ML models from scratch
- **Rich Tool Integration**: Natural language interface to complex security tools
- **Explainability**: Agents can explain their reasoning and decisions
- **Community Contribution**: Easy for security experts to contribute scenarios

### Negative
- **API Dependencies**: Reliance on external LLM providers for cloud deployments
- **Cost Considerations**: Token usage costs can scale with simulation complexity
- **Consistency Challenges**: LLM outputs may vary between identical scenarios
- **Security Risks**: Need careful sandboxing to prevent unintended actions
- **Performance Variability**: Response times depend on LLM provider load
- **Hallucination Risk**: LLMs may generate incorrect security information

### Neutral
- **Model Evolution**: Need to adapt to new LLM capabilities and limitations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Requires expertise in prompt design and optimization
- **Evaluation Complexity**: Harder to benchmark than traditional ML approaches
- **Integration Complexity**: Complex orchestration between LLM, tools, and memory
