## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### For Security Issues in This Project

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue**
2. **Email security@gan-cyber-range.org** with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: 1 month

## Security Architecture

### Isolation Requirements

This project requires strict isolation:

```yaml
# Required isolation layers
Network:
  - Separate VLAN or network segment
  - No internet access for test environments
  - Firewall rules blocking outbound connections

Container:
  - Docker network isolation
  - Resource limits enforced
  - Non-root user execution
  - Read-only filesystem where possible

Kubernetes:
  - Network policies enforcing isolation
  - RBAC with minimal permissions
  - Pod security policies
  - Resource quotas and limits
```

### Security Controls

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access review

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure secret management
- No sensitive data in logs
- Data classification and handling

#### Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Incident response procedures

## Vulnerability Management

### Classification System

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution without authentication
- Complete system compromise
- Data breach affecting sensitive information

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Significant data exposure

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leakage
- Configuration issues
- Non-exploitable bugs

### Remediation SLAs
- **Critical**: 24 hours
- **High**: 72 hours
- **Medium**: 1 week
- **Low**: 1 month

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding
```python
# Input validation
def validate_input(user_input):
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input type")
    if len(user_input) > MAX_LENGTH:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")
    return sanitize(user_input)

# Secure configuration
SECURE_DEFAULTS = {
    'debug': False,
    'ssl_verify': True,
    'timeout': 30,
    'max_retries': 3
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checks
- Supply chain security

### For Researchers

#### Environment Setup
1. Use isolated virtual machines
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Enable comprehensive logging
4. Backup and restore points

#### Data Handling
- Anonymize sensitive data
- Encrypt research data
- Secure data transfer
- Proper data disposal

## Incident Response

### Response Team
- **Security Lead**: Primary coordinator
- **Development Team**: Technical remediation
- **Operations Team**: Infrastructure impact
- **Communications**: Stakeholder updates

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Identify security incident
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat completely
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

### Communication Plan
- Internal team notification: Immediate
- Stakeholder updates: Within 4 hours
- Public disclosure: After remediation (if applicable)
- Regulatory reporting: As required

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **OWASP Security Guidelines**
- **ISO 27001 Controls**
- **SOC 2 Type II**

### Regular Assessments
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Third-party security audits
