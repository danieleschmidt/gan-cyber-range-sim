## Security Guidelines

### Responsible Research
- **Test Only in Isolation**: Use containerized environments
- **No Real Vulnerabilities**: Don't introduce actual security flaws
- **Ethical Use Only**: Ensure defensive focus of contributions
- **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations

### Code Review Requirements
- All security-related code requires two approvals
- Vulnerability simulations must be clearly documented
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- Proper input validation and sanitization

## Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use Black for formatting
- Use isort for imports

### Security Code Patterns
```python
# Good: Parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# Bad: String concatenation
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability simulation validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete scenario testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=gan_cyber_range

# Run security tests only
pytest tests/security/

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/
```
